Institutions that offer only associates degrees or profession certificates, such as community colleges and trade schools, have been excluded. Community colleges and trade schools often have different goals (e.g. facilitating transfers, direct career education) than institutions that offer four-year bachelors degrees. By comparing four-year colleges only to other four-year colleges, we'll have clearer analyses and conclusions.\n",
