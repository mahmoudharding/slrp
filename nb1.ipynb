    "When analyzing variables of interest, it's often helpful to calculate summary statistics. For quantitative variables, we can use the `summary` command to find the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) and the average (mean) of the values. The code block shows how we find these summary statistics for the `admit_rate` variable. Note: the `$` sign in R is used to isolate a single variable (`admit_rate`) from a dataframe (`dat`)."
